    "6. 85% (or 142 out of 166) of the avaialble frac jobs are successful jobs.\n",
    "7. There are 11 types of proppant used yet Ceramics is the most used proppant type and it accounts for 51% (or 64 out of 124) of all proppants used.\n",
    "8. There are 10 mesh sizes used while some jobs included various mesh sizes where the most used proppant size is 16/13 and it represents 57% (or 71 out of 124) mesh sizes use.\n",
    "9. All jobs are carried out by two different service companies, where Schlumberger accounted for 68% of the jobs (or 120 out of 175 jobs).\n",

    "**Answer:**\n",
    "* We can observe that as fluid efficiency increases, max treating pressure reached on surface decreases as well as saving cost by reducing amount of proppant mass injected! The highest proppant mass used are usually accompanied with low fluid efficiencies.\n",
    "* we can see that some proppant types such as ISP usually accomplish low fluid efficiency and low treating pressure, while HSP and Ceramics usually require higher treating pressures!\n",
    "* We can also see that proppant size of 12/18 and 16/30 could achieve high fluid efficiencies with intermediate treatment pressure, while mesh size of 20/40 usually achieve low fluid efficiency and very high treating pressures!\n",
    "* we can see that there is no reationship between increasing slurry injection rate and the fluid efficiency since we achieve same fluid efficincies with various inj. rates!"

    "* We can see that for the same formation and successful operations, changing proppant size affected the closure pressure, sch that for Bahareya; 16/20 and 16/30 sizes caused very low closure pressure, yet a size of 20/40 tripled the closure pressure!\n",
    "* we can also see that this is affected by proppant type such that Carbolite and premium caused small closure values.\n",
    "* Yet we can see that this case of high closure pressure is a case of foam injection! yet we can see from the above chart that foam is not necessarily to cause increase in closure pressure, so it could be characteristics of the formatiom/prop type, size!\n",
    "* we can therafter see that fluid efficiency of hiway frac is usually very low compared to conventional frac!"
